## 🎥 Demo

## 🔧 Setup 

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oubotong/EZ-chatbot.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your own OpenAI API key
 
5. Start the demo and enjoy:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   By default, it uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` model. If you wish to use a different model, you can easily modify it in the `app.py` file.

## 🚀 Future Plans

I am constantly working to improve the EZ-chatbot and add new features to make it even better. Here's a sneak peek at what's on the roadmap:

- [ ] Integrate with Langchain to handle knowledge-based queries (Pdf, Doc, SQL database...)
- [ ] Support various models (Vicuna, Falcon...)
- [ ] Add STT translation when asking questions through microphone

Stay tuned for more updates!
